      SOUNDBUDZ IS FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY LOVE LIVE MUSIC

    <p className="about-paragraph">
      You won't always have the same music interest as a friend. Sometimes
      you'll need to find others who share your passion for an artist and who
      you can go to a live event with.
    </p>
    <p className="about-paragraph">
      SoundBudz does exactly that. It connects you with like minded people so
      you get to talk about the artist you love and together, see them play.
